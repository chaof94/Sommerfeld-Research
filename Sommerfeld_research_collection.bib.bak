Using sophisticated crystal growth modes and device fabrication techniques, the capability of high power applications was also demonstrated. But with increasing drain-source voltages Vds>3 V it new parasitic phenomenon can be detected additive to the well-known gate leakage mechanism. An exponentially growing gate current bump, strongly dependent on the HFET design, appears at positive gate-source voltages V gs},

abstract = {The plane wave scattering and absorption by finite and infinite gratings of free-space standing graphene strips are studied in the THz range. Both finite and infinite gratings are studied. The formulation involves modified boundary conditions imposed on the strips. We build an accurate numerical solution to this problem based on the hyper-singular integral equations and the Nystrom method of their discretization. This guarantees fast convergence and controlled accuracy of computations. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance as a function of the wavelength and the grating parameters are analyzed, revealing surface-plasmon resonances and gradual build-up of Rayleigh anomalies if the number of strips gets larger than a few dozens.},

The 4-fold super-resolution power of the scheme, able to resolve 60 nm feature sizes at the operating wavelength, is demonstrated against both Abbe's (imaging a single object) and Rayleigh's (imaging two closely spaced objects) criteria.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

This instability caused by the current flow is similar to the "shallow water" instability in the gated 2D electron gas [see M. Dyakonov and M. S. Shur, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 2465 (1993)]. The mathematics of the problem correspond to "deep water" solutions for plasma waves. Just like in the "shallow water" case, this instability occurs when the boundary conditions correspond to zero ac voltage at the source and zero ac current at the drain. Such boundary conditions can be realized using either an external circuit or a depleted region at the drain. For the same device dimensions and electron mobility, the plasma wave generated in an ungated 2D device has a much higher frequency and, as a consequence, a much higher resonance quality factor, which makes the ungated devices promising for applications in resonant terahertz detectors.

abstract = {A general electrodynamic theory of a grating coupled two dimensional electron system (2DES) is developed. The 2DES is treated quantum mechanically, the grating is considered as a periodic system of thin metal strips or as an array of quantum wires, and the interaction of collective (plasma) excitations in the system with electromagnetic field is treated within the classical electrodynamics. It is assumed that a dc current flows in the 2DES. We consider a propagation of an electromagnetic wave through the structure, and obtain analytic dependencies of the transmission, reflection, absorption and emission coefficients on the frequency of light, drift velocity of 2D electrons, and other physical and geometrical parameters of the system. If the drift velocity of 2D electrons exceeds a threshold value, a current-driven plasma instability is developed in the system, and an incident far infrared radiation is amplified. We show that in the structure with a quantum wire grating the threshold velocity of the amplification can be essentially reduced, as compared to the commonly employed metal grating, down to experimentally achievable values. Physically this is due to a considerable enhancement of the grating coupler efficiency because of the resonant interaction of plasma modes in the 2DES and in the grating. We show that tunable far infrared emitters, amplifiers and generators can thus be created at realistic parameters of modern semiconductor heterostructures.},

abstract = {Given an analytic function f and a Jordan curve $\gamma$ that does not pass through any zero of f, we consider the problem of computing all the zeros of f that lie inside $\gamma$, together with their respective multiplicities. Our principal means of obtaining information about the location of these zeros is a certain symmetric bilinear form that can be evaluated via numerical integration along $\gamma$. If f has one or several clusters of zeros, then the mapping from the ordinary moments associated with this form to the zeros and their respective multiplicities is very ill-conditioned. We present numerical methods to calculate the centre of a cluster and its weight, i.e., the arithmetic mean of the zeros that form a certain cluster and the total number of zeros in this cluster, respectively. Our approach relies on formal orthogonal polynomials and rational interpolation at roots of unity. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques.},

ZEAL is based on the theory of formal orthogonal polynomials.

The elementary sequence transformations obtained in this way can be iterated leading to new nonlinear sequence transformations. Since the elementary sequence transformations, which are iterated, normally depend on n explicitly and not only implicitly via the sequence elements sn, sn+1,..., sn+l, on which they act, there is a nonuniqueness problem which means that more than a single admissible iteration can usually be constructed. Numerical examples show that different admissible iterations of the same elementary sequence transformation may behave quite differently in convergence acceleration and summation problems. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The respective eigenvalue problems are particularly challenging because they require the high precision computation of all multiple complex roots of f (z) confined to the specified finite domain.

With the assistance of another method, the program is able to deal effectively with f(x) that have a moderate singularity at one or both ends of [a, b].

abstract = {Tephritid fruit flies belonging to the Rhagoletis pomonella sibling species complex are controversial because they have been proposed to diverge in sympatry (in the absence of geographic isolation) by shifting and adapting to new host plants. Here, we report evidence suggesting a surprising source of genetic variation contributing to sympatric host shifts for these flies. From DNA sequence data for three nuclear loci and mtDNA, we infer that an ancestral, hawthorn-infesting R. pomonella population became geographically subdivided into Mexican and North American isolates approximately 1.57 million years ago. Episodes of gene flow from Mexico subsequently infused the North American population with inversion polymorphism affecting key diapause traits, forming adaptive clines. Sometime later (perhaps +/-1 million years), diapause variation in the latitudinal clines appears to have aided North American flies in adapting to a variety of plants with differing fruiting times, helping to spawn several new taxa. Thus, important raw genetic material facilitating the adaptive radiation of R. pomonella originated in a different time and place than the proximate ecological host shifts triggering sympatric divergence.},

abstract = {Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a very important super-resolution microscopy technique, which provides high speed super-resolution with about two-fold spatial resolution enhancement. Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported. However, most of these highlight only one specific aspect of the SIM reconstruction – such as the determination of the illumination pattern phase shift accurately – whereas other key elements – such as determination of modulation factor, estimation of object power spectrum, Wiener filtering frequency components with inclusion of object power spectrum information, translocating and the merging of the overlapping frequency components – are usually glossed over superficially. In addition, most of the work reported lie scattered throughout the literature and a comprehensive review of the theoretical background is found lacking. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) to collect the essential theoretical details of SIM algorithm at one place, thereby making them readily accessible to readers for the first time; and 2) to provide an open source SIM reconstruction code (named OpenSIM), which enables users to interactively vary the code parameters and study it's effect on reconstructed SIM image.},

abstract = {This work presents the design and measurements of a 0.54 THz signal generator implemented in a 40 nm bulk CMOS technology. An LC-VCO operating at 180 GHz is connected to a nonlinear buffer, which is designed to generate the wanted third harmonic at 540 GHz. The third harmonic is coupled via a transformer to the output. The developed techniques are implemented on two different chips: one with a probe pad for on-wafer measurements and one with an on-chip planar dipole. The measured peak output power using a WR-1.5 probe is -31 dBm at 543 GHz, for 16.8 mW of dc power consumption. By changing value of the parasitic I-MOS varactors of the LC-VCO (“parasitic tuning”), the output frequency can be tuned from 561.5 to 539.6 GHz, resulting in a 21.9 GHz tuning range, which is the highest reported so far for CMOS THz oscillators. The 3-dB output bandwidth is 5.5 GHz. The 540 GHz signal generator with on-chip antenna is used for THz imaging without the use of substrate or focusing lenses, demonstrating some of the capabilities of CMOS for low-cost, mass-produced THz imagers.},

abstract = {A review is presented of the extrapolation methods for accelerating the convergence of Sommerfeld-type integrals (i.e. semi-infinite range integrals with Bessel function kernels), which arise in problems involving antennas or scatterers embedded in planar multilayered media. Attention is limited to partition-extrapolation procedures in which the Sommerfeld integral is evaluated as a sum of a series of partial integrals over finite subintervals and is accelerated by an extrapolation method applied over the real-axis tail segment ($\alpha$,∞) of the integration path, where $\alpha$>0 is selected to ensure that the integrand is well behaved. An analytical form of the asymptotic truncation error (or the remainder), which characterizes the convergence properties of the sequence of partial sums and serves as a basis for some of the most efficient extrapolation methods, is derived. Several extrapolation algorithms deemed to be the most suitable for the Sommerfeld integrals are described and their performance is compared. It is demonstrated that the performance of these methods is strongly affected by the horizontal displacement of the source and field points $\rho$ and by the choice of the subinterval break points. Furthermore, it is found that some well-known extrapolation techniques may fail for a number of values of $\rho$ and ways to remedy this are suggested. Finally, the most effective extrapolation methods for accelerating Sommerfeld integral tails are recommended},

abstract = {The analysis of 2D scattering in the presence of a dielectric half-space by integral-equation formulations involves repeated evaluation of Sommerfeld integrals. Deformation of the contour to the steepest-descent path results in a well-behaved integrand, that can be readily integrated. A well-known drawback of this method is that an analytical expression for the path is available only for evaluation of the reflected fields, but not for the evaluation of the transmitted fields. A simple scheme for numerical determination of the steepest-descent path, valid for both cases, is presented. The computational cost of the numerical determination is comparable to that of evaluating the analytical expression for the steepest-descent path for reflected fields. When necessary, contributions from branch-cut integrals and a second saddle point are taken into account. Certain ranges of the input parameters, which result in integrands that vary rapidly in the neighborhood of the saddle point, require special treatment. Alternative paths and specialized Gaussian quadrature rules for these cases are also proposed. An implementation of the proposed numerically determined steepest-descent path (ND-SDP) method is freely available for download.},

Therefore, SI tails have to be specially treated. In this paper we compare two recently developed techniques for their efficient numerical evaluation. First, a partition-extrapolation method, in which the integration-then-summation procedure is combined with a new version of the weighted averages (WA) extrapolation technique, is summarized. The previous variants of WA technique are also discussed. Then, a review of double-exponential (DE) quadrature formulas for direct integration of the SI tails is presented. The efficient way of implementing the algorithms, their pros and cons, as well as comparisons of their performance are discussed in detail.},

Based on the D-field formulation, inhomogeneity and surface charge can be treated correctly. Modelling the geometry by triangles, this surface integral equation is discretized and is suitable for the method of moments to solve. Rao-Wilson-Glisson and pulse functions are employed simultaneously for basis and testing functions and so the moment solution has full descriptions of polarization current in the thin dielectric layer. Several examples are examined by both analytical and other published numerical methods. These results show excellent agreement and demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this new integral equation.},

abstract = { Strips made of a resistive sheet material have lower backscattering cross sections than the corresponding perfectly conducting strips, and this is true in particular when the illumination is edge-on with the electric vector parallel to the edge. Attention is focused on this case. Using the moment method applied to an appropriate integral equation, data are obtained for the surface field and backscattered far field of a resistive strip for a variety of strip widths<tex>w</tex>and uniform resistances<tex>R</tex>. The front- and rear-edge contributions to the far field are then extracted. It is shown that for strips whose width is greater than about a half-wavelength the former is the same as for a half-plane having the same resistance, whereas the latter is proportional to the square of the current at that point on the half-plane corresponding to the rear edge of the strip. The implications of these results on the selection of a strip resistance for low backscattering are discussed.},

Several formulation types are considered and used to investigate the scattering by different objects. It is found that for moderate values of the dielectric constant, all formulation types give satisfactory results. However, for small or large relative permittivities the solution accuracies depend on the formulation type. As an application of the method to practical problems, two special cases of dielectric rod and microstrip antennas are considered. These antennas have widespread applications and the proposed method can be used to investigate their performance accurately.},

Drain-current dispersion effects are investigated when gate or drain voltages are pulsed. Gate-lag and drain-lag turn-on measurements are analyzed, revealing clear mechanisms of current collapse and related dispersion effects. Numerical 2-D transient simulations considering surface traps effects in a physical HEMT model have also been carried out. A comparison between experimental and theoretical results is shown. The presence of donor-type traps acting as hole traps, due to their low energy level of 0.25 eV relative to the valence band, with densities >1e20 cm-3 (>5e12 cm-2), uniformly distributed at the HEMT surface, and interacting with the free holes that accumulated at the top surface due to piezoelectric fields, accounts for the experimentally observed effects. Time constants next to 10 ms are deduced. Some additional features in the measured transient currents, with faster time constants, could not be associated with surface states},

abstract = {In this paper, we report progress in the development of a detector for photons in the terahertz region consisting of a lateral quantum dot (QD), defined in a semiconductor heterostructure by mesa patterning and three negatively biased metallic gates, and a single-electron transistor (SET) on top of the mesa and, hence, capacitively coupled to the QD. We study the behavior of the QD as a function of the potential applied to the gates using the SET as a sensitive charge detector and identify the bias region of the device, where it is sensitive to incident terahertz radiation. The QD converts incident photons into charge excitations, which can be detected by the SET, resulting in a signal of the order 10(8) electrons for each absorbed photon. Based on the dark count rate and an estimate of the quantum efficiency, the detector should enable low-power measurements in the terahertz region with noise-equivalent power similar to 10(-19) W/Hz(1/2) exceeding the sensitivity of commercially available bolometers by two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {This paper reports on field-effect-transistor-based terahertz detectors for the operation at discrete frequencies spanning from 0.2 to 4.3 THz. They are implemented using a 150-nm CMOS process technology, employ self-mixing in the n-channels of the transistors and operate well above the transistors' cutoff frequency. The theoretical description of device operation by Dyakonov and Shur is extended in order to describe the device impedance, responsivity, and noise-equivalent power for a novel detection concept, which couples the signal to the drain. This approach enables quasi-static (QS) detection and calibration of the detectors. The different transport regimes (i.e., QS, distributed resistive, and plasmonic mixing) and their transitions are theoretically discussed and experimentally accessed. Responsivity values of 350 V/W at 595 GHz, 30 V/W at 2.9 THz, and 5 V/W at 4.1 THz are reported. At 0.595 THz, we determine the optical noise equivalent power (NEP) to be 42 pW/√Hz ; at 2.9 THz, the value is 487 pW/√Hz. All values are reported for optimum gate bias with respect to NEP at 295 K. For 0.595 THz, theory predicts a NEP value at threshold as low as 2 pW/√Hz for ideal coupling of the radiation.},

The reduction of volume to surface IE is based on representation of the electric field in the cylinder cross section in the form of a single-layer ansatz. Substitution of such surface based electric field representation into the volume IE reduces it to a surface IE with respect to the unknown surface current density. Since the new surface IE enforces exactly the field continuity at the material interfaces, the radiation condition as well as underlying Helmholtz equations both inside and outside the penetrable cylinder, it is rigorously equivalent to the solution of Maxwell's equations. The method of moments discretization of the new IE is shown to produce an error-controllable field approximation. Due to the presence of a product of surface-to-volume and volume-to-surface integral operators, the discretization of the novel surface-volume-surface IE requires both surface and volume meshes.},

abstract = {Graphene, owing to its ability to support plasmon polariton waves in the terahertz frequency range, enables the miniaturization of antennas to allow wireless commu- nications among nanosystems. One of the main challenges in the demonstration of graphene antennas is finding suitable terahertz sources to feed the antenna. This pa- per estimates the performance of a graphene RF plasmonic micro-antenna fed with a photoconductive source. The terahertz source ismodeled and, bymeans of a full-wave EM solver, the radiated power of the device is estimated with respect to material, laser illumination and antenna geometry parameters. The results show that the pro- posed device radiates terahertz pulses with an average power up to 1 µW, proving the feasibility of feeding miniaturized graphene antennas with photoconductive materials.},

abstract = {The plane wave scattering and absorption by finite and infinite gratings of free-space standing infinitely long graphene strips are studied in the THz range. A novel numerical approach, based on graphene surface impedance, hyper-singular integral equations, and the Nystrom method, is proposed. This technique guarantees fast convergence and controlled accuracy of computations. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance are carefully studied as a function of graphene and grating parameters, revealing the presence of surface plasmon resonances. Specifically, larger graphene relaxation times increases the number of resonances in the THz range, leading to higher wave transmittance due to the reduced losses; on the other hand an increase of graphene chemical potential up-shifts the frequency of plasmon resonances. It is also shown that a relatively low number of graphene strips (>10) are able to reproduce Rayleigh anomalies. These features make graphene strips good candidates for many applications, including tunable absorbers and frequency selective surfaces.},

abstract = {—Plasmons in two-dimensional semiconductor devices will be reflected by discontinuities, notably, junctions between gated and non-gated electron channels. The transmitted and reflected plasmons can form spatially-and frequency-varying signals, and their understanding is important for the design of terahertz detectors, oscillators, and plasmonic crystals. Using mode decomposition, we studied terahertz plasmons incident on a junction between a gated and a nongated channel. The plasmon reflection and transmission coefficients were found numerically and analytically and studied between 0.3 and 1 THz for a range of electron densities. At higher frequencies, we could describe the plasmons by a simplified model of channels in homogeneous dielectrics, for which the analytical approximations were accurate. At low frequencies, however, the full geometry and mode spectrum had to be taken into account. The results agreed with simulations by the finite-element method. Mode decomposition thus proved to be a powerful method for plasmonic devices, combining the rigor of complete solutions of Maxwell's equations with the convenience of analytical expressions.},

Reactive-ion etching provides an effective technique for fabricating both classical and quantum devices. However, Fermi level pinning can occur, and must be carefully considered in the development of small devices, such as quantum dots. Because of depletion, the electrical size of the device is reduced in comparison with its physical dimension. To investigate this issue, we fabricate several types of devices in silicon-germanium heterostructures using two different etches, CF$_4$ and SF$_6$. We estimate the depletion width associated with each etch by two methods: (i) conductance measurements in etched wires of decreasing thickness (to determine the onset of depletion), (ii) capacitance measurements of quantum dots (to estimate the size of the active region). We find that the SF$_6$ etch causes a much smaller depletion width, making it more suitable for device fabrication.},

We find that the essential character of the response—multiple resonances corresponding to spatial harmonics of standing plasmons under the metal grating—is caused by the static spatial modulation of electron density in the channel. Higher order plasmon modes become more optically active as the depth of the electron density modulation in the DQW tends towards unity. The maximum absorbance, at plasma resonance, is shown to be 1/2. Furthermore, the strongest absorption also occurs when the standing plasmon resonance coincides with the fundamental dipole mode of the ungated portion of the channel.},

The density-of-states effective mass of Nb-doped STO, which was estimated from the carrier concentration and Seebeck coefficient, was larger than that of La-doped STO. Thermal conductivity of the samples, which was similar to that of undoped STO single crystal, decreased proportionally to T-1, indicating that the phonon conduction takes place predominantly and the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity is negligible.},

There are mainly three bottlenecks of the CPU time for such problem: matrix filling, matrix inversion and calculation of the scattered fields. For moderately sized problems, extensive numerical experience shows that the CPU time used in the first and third items (concerned with the Sommerfeld integrals) is much more than that used in the matrix inversion. Therefore an efficient method for solving such buried object problems requires the fast evaluation of such Sommerfeld integrals. In this paper, several efficient methods are presented to evaluate the integrals that appear in the TM wave scattering by two-dimensional buried dielectric and conducting cylinders.

In the method of steepest descent, the leading and higher-order approximation of the saddle point, and the contribution of the branch point are formulated.

abstract = {The classical Sommerfeld half-space problem is revisited, with generalizations to multilayer and plasmonic media and focus on the surface field computation. A new ab initio solution is presented for an arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipole radiating in the presence of a material half-space with arbitrary horizontal stratification. The solution method combines the vector potential approach and the spectral domain transmission line analog of the medium, which results in the most compact formulation and facilitates the inclusion of any number of layers in the analysis. Following Sommerfeld, the solution is first expressed in terms of the Fourier–Bessel transforms, also known as Sommerfeld integrals. Analytical properties of the integrands in the complex plane are then investigated, including the location of the Sommerfeld pole, which gives rise to the Zenneck wave (ZW) or surface plasmon polariton (SPP), and alternative field representations are developed by a deformation of the integration path and analytic continuation of the integrand functions, using hyperbolic and vertical branch cuts. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic surface fields are also derived and the r{\^{o}}le of the ZWand SPP is elucidated. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the theory, from radio frequencies to visible light.},

abstract = {We summarize three lines of development and investigation of foundry-processed patch-antenna-coupled Si MOSFETs as detectors of THz radiation: (i) Exploiting the pinciple of plasma-waved-based mixing in the two-dimensional electron gas of the transistors' channels, we demonstrate efficient detection at frequencies as high as 9 THz, much above the transit-time-limited cut-off frequencies of the devices (tens of GHz). Real-time imaging at 600 GHz with a 12 × 12 detector array is explored. (ii) Given the limited THz power usually available for applications, we explore imaging with enhanced sensitivity in heterodyne mode. We show that real-time operation of a 100 × 100-pixel heterodyne camera should be possible at 600 GHz with a better dynamic range (30 dB) than for direct power detection (20 dB), even if only a quarter-milliwatt of local-oscillator power, distributed radiatively over all detector pixels, is available. (iii) Finally, we present an all-electronic raster-scan imaging system for 220 GHz entirely based on CMOS devices, combining the CMOS detectors with an emitter circuit implemented in a 90-nm CMOS process and delivering radiation with a power on the 100- $\mu$W scale. Considering progress in the field, we anticipate that the emitter concept of oscillator-based power generation with on-chip frequency multiplication will carry well into the sub-millimeter-wave regime.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present sensitivity measurement as well as measured and calculated absorption spectra for AlGaN/GaN THz plasmonic detector made of a metallic grating in-between two ohmic contacts. Detectors with different grating patterns have been fabricated and their sensitivity, reaching 1.9 $\mu$A/W at 77 K and 0.7 $\mu$A/W at 300 K, measured with a voltage applied between the ohmic contacts. It is the first time that such a detector shows THz detection with no voltage applied on the grating, namely with a bidimensional electron gas (2DEG) having a homogeneous electron density. These results are consistent with detection by drag-effect rectification. Measurements held between 0.648 and 0.690 THz show that the dependence of the sensitivity on the frequency follows the absorption spectrum, indicating that absorption is a crucial step in the detection process. Further simulations of absorption spectra show the tunability offered by such detector and allow us to predict frequency behavior for grating-biased detectors as well, in which the rectification is mainly governed by ratchet effect.},

abstract = {A terahertz (THz) imaging system and high efficient terahertz sources and detectors for medical applications were developed. A fiber laser based compact time domain terahertz tomography system was developed with a high depth resolution of less than 20 mu m. Three-dimensional images of porcine skin were obtained including some physical properties such as applied skin creams. The discrimination between healthy human tissue and tumor tissue has been achieved using reflection spectra. To improve the THz imaging system, a ridge waveguide LiNbO3 based nonlinear terahertz generator was studied to achieve high output power. A ridge waveguide with 5-7 mu m width was designed for high efficiency emission from the LiNbO3 crystal by the electro-optic Cherenkov effect. Terahertz electronic sources and detectors were also realized for future imaging systems. As electronic source devices, resonant tunneling diode (RTD) oscillators with a patch antenna were fabricated using an InGaAs/InAlAs/AlAs triple barrier structure. On the other side, Schottky barrier diode (SBD) detectors with a log-periodic antenna were fabricated by thin-film technology on a Si substrate. Both devices operate above 1 THz at room temperature. This electronic THz device set could provide a future high performance imaging system.},

abstract = {We obtain a short-distance expansion for the half-space, frequency domain electromagnetic Green's tensor. The small parameter of the theory is \\omega \\epsilon_1 {\\cal L}/c , where o is the frequency, [?]1 is the permittivity of the upper half-space, in which both the source and the point of observation are located, and which is assumed to be transparent, c is the speed of light in vacuum and {\\cal L} is a characteristic length, defined as the distance from the point of observation to the reflected (with respect to the planar interface) position of the source. In the case when the lower half-space (the substrate) is characterized by a complex permittivity [?]2, we compute the expansion to third order. For the case when the substrate is a transparent dielectric, we compute the imaginary part of the Green's tensor to seventh order. The analytical calculations are verified numerically. The practical utility of the obtained expansion is demonstrated by computing the radiative lifetime of two electromagnetically interacting molecules in the vicinity of a transparent dielectric substrate. The computation is performed in the strong interaction regime when the quasi-particle pole approximation is inapplicable. In this regime, the integral representation for the half-space Green's tensor is difficult to use while its electrostatic limiting expression is grossly inadequate. However, the analytical expansion derived in this paper can be used directly and efficiently. The results of this study are also relevant to nano-optics and near-field imaging, especially when tomographic image reconstruction is involved.},

It is found that the maximum gain obtainable from a broad-band antenna is approximately equal to that of the uniformly illuminated aperture. If higher gain is desired, the antenna must necessarily be a narrow-band device. In fact, the input impedance becomes frequency sensitive so rapidly that, for large antennas, no significant increase in gain over that of the uniformly illuminated aperture is possible. Also, if the antenna is lossy, the efficiency falls rapidly as the gain is increased over that of the uniformly illuminated aperture.},

abstract = {Concise and explicit formulas for dyadic Green's functions, representing the electric and magnetic fields due to a dipole source placed in layered media, are derived in this paper. First, the electric and magnetic fields in the spectral domain for the half space are expressed using Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients. Each component of electric field in the spectral domain constitutes the spectral Green's function in layered media. The Green's function in the spatial domain is then recovered involving Sommerfeld integrals for each component in the spectral domain. By using Bessel identities, the number of Sommerfeld integrals are reduced, resulting in much simpler and more efficient formulas for numerical implementation compared with previous results. This approach is extended to the three-layer Green's function. In addition, the singular part of the Green's function is naturally separated out so that integral equation methods developed for free space Green's functions can be used with minimal modification. Numerical results are included to show efficiency and accuracy of the derived formulas.},

Far infrared reflectivity spectra for single crystals and ceramics of LaAlO3 were measured and eigenfrequencies and damping constants of transverse and longitudinal optical modes were evaluated in order to discuss variations in the dielectric properties. The observed reflectivity spectra were fitted by four IR active modes (predicted by factor group analysis) in order to calculate the vibration eigenfrequencies and damping constants. Differences in dielectric loss were found between the two kinds of single crystals, having different crystal orientations. It was inferred that the difference in dielectric loss was due to difference in cut off frequencies of these single crystals. The loss obtained from the IR reflectivity of the ceramics was used to evaluate the extrinsic loss in the ceramics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The data were corrected for surface effects, such as surface roughness or adsorbed overlayers. The authors report Tauc–Lorentz model parameters for LaAlO3 at 300 K. After annealing in UHV for 20 h, the surface layer thickness decreased from 15A ˚ to less than 1A ˚ . They speculate that the anneal causes surface modifications, such as the evaporation of adsorbed molecular layers (hydrocarbons or water) or surface vacancies, and that surface diffusion leads to a reduction of surface roughness. They have also measured the temperature-dependence of the refractive index at 1.96eV between 77 and 700K and given a theoretical explanation of its origin.},

Despite this dramatic growth, however, the EM community lacked a comprehensive text on the computational techniques used to solve EM problems. The first edition of Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics filled that gap and became the reference of choice for thousands of engineers, researchers, and students.The Second Edition of this bestselling text reflects the continuing increase in awareness and use of numerical techniques and incorporates advances and refinements made in recent years. Most notable among these are the improvements made to the standard algorithm for the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and treatment of absorbing boundary conditions in FDTD, finite element, and transmission-line- matrix methods. The author also added a chapter on the method of lines.Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics continues to teach readers how to pose, numerically analyze, and solve EM problems, give them the ability to expand their problem-solving skills using a variety of methods, and prepare them for research in electromagnetism. Now the Second Edition goes even further toward providing a comprehensive resource that addresses all of the most useful computation methods for EM problems.},

abstract = {One of the most important recent developments in semiconductors, both from the point of view of physics and for the purpose of device developments, has been the achievement of structures in which the electronic behavior is essentially two-dimensional (2D). This means that, at least for some phases of operation of the device, the carriers are confined in a potential such that their motion in one direction is restricted and thus is quantized, leaving only a two-dimensional momentum or k-vector which characterizes motion in a plane normal to the confining potential. The major systems where such 2D behavior has been studied are MOS structures, quantum wells and superlattices. More recently, quantization has been achieved in 1-dimension (the quantum wires) and " zero " –dimensions (the quantum dots). These topics are further discussed in Chapter 10 and in the course on semiconductor physics (6.735J). 9.2 MOSFETS One of the most useful and versatile of these structures is the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) layered structures, the most important of these being the metal-oxide-semiconductor 140 Figure 9.1: Cross-sectional view of the basic MOSFET structure showing the terminal designations and standard biasing conditions. (MOS) structures. As shown in Fig. 9.1, the MOS device is fabricated from a substrate of usually moderately-doped p-type or n-type silicon which together with its grounded electrode is called the base and labeled B in the figure. On the top of the base is grown an insulating layer of silicon dioxide, followed by a metal layer; this structure is the gate (labeled G in the figure) and is used to apply an electric field through the oxide to the silicon. For the MOS device shown in the figure the base region is p-type and the source (S) and drain (D) regions are n-type. Measurements of the changes in the properties of the carriers in the silicon layer immediately below the gate (the conductance in the source-drain channel), in response to changes in the applied electric field at the gate electrode, are called field-effect measurements. As we show below, the field dramatically changes the conducting properties of the carriers beneath the gate. Use is made of this effect in the so-called metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). To understand the operation of this device,we first consider the schematic energy band diagram of the MOS structure as shown in Fig. 9.2, for four different values of V G , the gate potential relative to the substrate. For each V G value, the diagram shows from left to right the metal (M) -oxide (O) -semiconductor (S) regions. In the semiconductor regions each of the diagrams show from top to bottom: the Si conduction band edge E c , the " intrinsic " Fermi level for undoped Si as the dashed line, the Fermi level E F in the p-type Si, and the valence band edge E v . In each diagram, the central oxide region shows the valence band edge for the oxide. On the left hand side of each diagram, the Fermi level for the metal is shown and the dashed line gives the extension of the Si Fermi level. In the lower part of the figure, the charge layers of the interfaces for each case are illustrated. We now explain the diagrams in Fig. 9.2 as a function of the gate voltage V G . For V G = 0 (the flat-band case), there are (ideally) no charge layers, and the energy levels of the metal (M) and semiconducting (S) regions line up to yield the same Fermi level (chemical potential). The base region is doped p-type. For a negative gate voltage (V G < 0, the accumulation case), an electric field is set up in the oxide. The negative gate voltage 141},

abstract = {The advancement in fluorescence microscopy has dramatically enhanced the obtainable optical resolution enabling the users to inspect the structures of interest at finer and finer level of detail. This chapter describes some of these methods and how they break the classical resolution limit. The labeling of targets, such as individual genetic loci, specific proteins, or organelles, is possible inside living cells, which led to the extensive use of fluorescence microscopy in life sciences. Other microscopic modes usually lack this high specificity but sometimes provide other useful information such as the orientation of molecular species in polarization microscopy. Modes, such as differential interference contrast, phase contrast, or dark field, are useful to discriminate and follow cells or structures within them without the need for specific labeling. However, classically the resolution of all of these light microscopic modes was far below that of the electron microscope, and only some recent approaches have made significant progress in resolution increase. Recently, many microscopy methods have dramatically enhanced the resolution. Gradually, these methods are now applied to solve biological problems. The most promising approaches are all based on fluorescence and use either nonlinear interaction of light with the sample (STED, nonlinear structured illumination, dynamic saturation optical microscopy, or saturation in the time domain) or precise localization of individual particles or molecules with subsequent image generation. ?? 2006 Oxford University Press.

To date, there have been no methods capable of controlling terahertz (THz) radiation at molecular scales. Here we report both generation and detection of broadband terahertz field from 10 nm scale oxide nanojunctions. Frequency components of ultrafast optical radiation are mixed at these nanojunctions, producing broadband THz emission. These same devices detect THz electric fields with comparable spatial resolution. This unprecedented control, on a scale of 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit, creates a pathway toward THz-bandwidth spectroscopy and control of individual nanoparticles and molecules.},

Since then, considerable progress has been made in various rare earth element-doped materials, with a recent record of cooling to 91 K directly from ambient temperatures. For practical use and to suit future applications of optical refrigeration, the discovery of materials with facile and scalable synthesis and high cooling power density will be required. Herein we present the realization of a net cooling of 23.0 K in micrometre-thick 3D CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and 58.7 K in exfoliated 2D (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (PhEPbI4) perovskite crystals directly from room temperature. We found that the perovskite crystals exhibit strong photoluminescence upconversion and near unity external quantum efficiency, properties that are responsible for the realization of net laser cooling. Our findings indicate that solution-processed perovskite thin films may be a highly suitable candidate for constructing integrated optical cooler devices.},

abstract = {At the start of this millennium, the principles of structured illumination microscopy (SIM) had been established and the concept of resolution doubling demonstrated experimentally in two dimensions. Breathtaking advances have since taken place, making SIM one of the most powerful and versatile superresolution methods available today, routinely used in the study of biochemical processes in laboratories around the world. In theory there is no inherent limit to the resolution obtainable with certain modalities of SIM, and new variants have the potential to operate at even higher speeds and sensitivity than currently realized. In this review, we focus on the very latest innovations in SIM theory and practice, which are set to continue the revolution of this method into the future. Examples include confocal implementations of the SIM principle, which can be used in combination with two-photon excitation and adaptive optics. We present recent applications of such approaches in the life sciences, which illustrate their potential to revolutionize intravital research, by providing the ability to watch life at the molecular scale, at high speeds, and deep within living organisms. A different variant makes use of standing plasmonic waves or localized surface plasmons to confer performance enhancements to 2D SIM modalities. Research on these latter techniques is in its infancy but already shows great potential for their development into powerful in vitro probes for chemical processes at solid/liquid interfaces. Physical concepts are reviewed in detail, and future directions are presented along which the field might fruitfully develop, holding promise for new discoveries on the molecular scale.},

The device features electronic tuning of plasmon characteristic frequencies, providing continuously-tunable operation below 1 THz to beyond 10 THz.

The position, width, and strength of the resonance agree with existing theory at electron densities) 10 /cm . At lower densities, the resonance position is below the predicted value, implying a substantial in-crease in the electron mass. We have observed, in the far-infrared trans-mission through a silicon metal-oxide-semicon-ductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), reso-nances which are due to plasmons in the two-di-mensional (2D) electron gas that forms the inver-sion layer. The plasmons are coupled to the radi-ation field by locating a grating structure in prox-imity to the electron gas. At large inversion-lay-er electron densities, n " where the electron gas is metallic, the resonance position, width, and intensity agree in detail with a theory of the coup-ling of the plasmons and the radiation field, while at low densities, &10'2/cm2, difficulties are en-countered that may be related to the anomalous electron localization often seen in these devices. Plasma oscillations of a 2D electron gas differ in a nontrivial way from the corresponding oscil-lations in a 3D system. This difference stems from the fact that the restoring force for the charge-density oscillations for the-2D system is provided by the electrostatic field which remains 3D, fringing into the space on either side of the 2D sheet of charge. This has a number of ir.$\sim$por-tant consequences that have been explored in great detail' " from a theoretical point of view, beginning with the work of Ritchie' on thin metal foils. There are two key features. (I) The fre-quency of the 2D plasmon goes to zero as the wave vector goes to zero. (2) The frequency is perturbed by the shape and dielectric properties of matter in the immediate vicinity of the electron gas. In marked contrast to the extensive theoret-ical development, the only experiment that has directly probed the 2D plasmon is the work re-ported recently by Grimes and Adams" and Platz-man and Beni" on electrons bound to a helium surface. Qur experiments were performed on an n-chan-nel Si MOSFET with peak mobility of 16 000 cm'/ V sec at 4. 2'K.

@article{Spitzer1962a,
abstract = {The room temperature reflectivity of BaTiO3, SrTiO3, and TiO2 has been measured from 5000 to 70 cm-1. These data have been analyzed by the Kramers-Kronig method and by classical dispersion theory. All of the infrared-active fundamental vibrations allowed by crystal symmetry have been measured and characterized by their dispersion parameters. Of particular interest is the low-frequency mode which recent theories show is responsible for ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 and is found at 33.8 and 87.7 cm-1, respectively. The unusually large damping found for this mode can explain the observed microwave loss tangents. The strength of the mode accounts for the large values of the low-frequency dielectric constant. This mode, as well as the highest frequency mode, 510 and 546 cm-1 in BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, respectively, is associated with TiO6 octahedra vibrations. A previously unreported mode at 183 and 178 cm-1 for BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, respectively, has also been found and assigned to a cation-(TiO3) vibration. In rutile, three resonances are observed for the ordinary ray and one for the extraordinary ray, as required by theory. As with the titanates, the high dielectric constant is associated with the low-frequency mode. An analysis of the strengths of all of the resonances shows that they involve resonable effective charges for ionic crystals.},

abstract = {This paper shows how to analyze plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguides using the full modal structure of these guides. The analysis applies to all frequencies, particularly including the near infrared and visible spectrum, and to a wide range of sizes, including nanometallic structures. We use the approach here specifically to analyze waveguide junctions. We show that the full modal structure of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides--which consists of real and complex discrete eigenvalue spectra, as well as the continuous spectrum--forms a complete basis set. We provide the derivation of these modes using the techniques developed for Sturm-Liouville and generalized eigenvalue equations. We demonstrate the need to include all parts of the spectrum to have a complete set of basis vectors to describe scattering within MIM waveguides with the mode-matching technique. We numerically compare the mode-matching formulation with finite-difference frequency-domain analysis and find very good agreement between the two for modal scattering at symmetric MIM waveguide junctions. We touch upon the similarities between the underlying mathematical structure of the MIM waveguide and the PT symmetric quantum mechanical pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The rich set of modes that the MIM waveguide supports forms a canonical example against which other more complicated geometries can be compared. Our work here encompasses the microwave results, but extends also to waveguides with real metals even at infrared and optical frequencies.},

At long wavelengths (q→0), the plasmon dispersion shows the local classical behavior $\omega$cl=$\omega$0√q, but the density dependence of the plasma frequency ($\omega$0∝n1∕4) is different from the usual 2D electron system ($\omega$0∝n1∕2). The wave-vector-dependent plasmon dispersion and the static screening function show very different behavior than the usual 2D case. We show that the intrinsic interband contributions to static graphene screening can be effectively absorbed in a background dielectric constant.},

@article{Jablan2009a,
abstract = {We point out that plasmons in doped graphene simultaneously enable low losses and significant wave localization for frequencies below that of the optical phonon branch h$\omega$_{Oph} $\sim$ 0.2 eV. Large plasmon losses occur in the interband regime (via excitation of electron-hole pairs), which can be pushed toward higher frequencies for higher-doping values. For sufficiently large dopings, there is a bandwidth of frequencies from ? Oph up to the interband threshold, where a plasmon decay channel via emission of an optical phonon together with an electron-hole pair is nonegligible. The calculation of losses is performed within the framework of a random-phase approximation and number conserving relaxation-time approximation. The measured DC relaxation-time serves as an input parameter characterizing collisions with impurities, whereas the contribution from optical phonons is estimated from the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the optical conduc- tivity. Optical properties of plasmons in graphene are in many relevant aspects similar to optical properties of surface plasmons propagating on dielectric-metal interface, which have been drawing a lot of interest lately because of their importance for nanophotonics. Therefore, the fact that plasmons in graphene could have low losses for certain frequencies makes them potentially interesting for nanophotonic applications.},

As a consequence, the developed theory opens an unexplored way to control transport properties of 2DEG by a strong high-frequency electromagnetic field. From experimental viewpoint, this theory is applicable directly to quantum wells exposed to a laser-generated electromagnetic wave.},

abstract = {We develop a systematic theory of microwave-induced oscillations in the magnetoresistivity of a two-dimensional electron gas, focusing on the regime of strongly overlapping Landau levels. At linear order in microwave power, two mechanisms of the oscillations ("quadrupole" and "photovoltaic") are identified, distinctly different from those studied before ("displacement" and "inelastic"). The quadrupole and photovoltaic mechanisms are shown to be the only ones that give rise to oscillations in the nondiagonal part of the photoconductivity tensor. In the diagonal part, the inelastic contribution dominates at moderate microwave power, while at elevated power the other mechanisms become relevant. We demonstrate the crucial role of feedback effects, which lead to a strong interplay of the four mechanisms in the nonlinear photoresponse and yield, in particular, a nonmonotonic power dependence of the photoconductivity, narrowing of the magnetoresonances, and a nontrivial structure of the Hall photoresponse. At ultrahigh power, all effects related to the Landau quantization decay due to a combination of the feedback and multiphoton effects, restoring the classical Drude conductivity.},

Based on the dyadic Green's function (Green's tensor) of a three-layer geometry, light scattering from electric point dipoles (representing small metal scatterers) located within a thin layer sandwiched between a substrate and a superstrate is analyzed. Starting from the full dyadic Green's function we derive analytical near-and far-field approximations. The far-field approximations enable efficient, exact, and separate evaluation of light scattering into waves that propagate in the substrate or the superstrate. Based on the near-field approximation we present a semianalytical expression for the total near-field absorption in the substrate. The theoretical approach is used to analyze realistic configurations for plasmon-assisted silicon solar cells. We show that by embedding metal nanoscatterers in a thin film with a high refractive index (rutile TiO(2) with n approximate to 2.5) on top of the silicon, the fraction of scattered light that couples into the solar cell can become larger than 96%, and an optical path length enhancement of more than 100 can be achieved.},

abstract = {Tephritid fruit flies belonging to the Rhagoletis pomonella sibling species complex are controversial because they have been proposed to diverge in sympatry (in the absence of geographic isolation) by shifting and adapting to new host plants. Here, we report evidence suggesting a surprising source of genetic variation contributing to sympatric host shifts for these flies. From DNA sequence data for three nuclear loci and mtDNA, we infer that an ancestral, hawthorn-infesting R. pomonella population became geographically subdivided into Mexican and North American isolates approximately 1.57 million years ago. Episodes of gene flow from Mexico subsequently infused the North American population with inversion polymorphism affecting key diapause traits, forming adaptive clines. Sometime later (perhaps +/-1 million years), diapause variation in the latitudinal clines appears to have aided North American flies in adapting to a variety of plants with differing fruiting times, helping to spawn several new taxa. Thus, important raw genetic material facilitating the adaptive radiation of R. pomonella originated in a different time and place than the proximate ecological host shifts triggering sympatric divergence.},

abstract = {High spatial frequencies in the illuminating light of microscopes lead to a shift of the object spatial frequencies detectable through the objective lens. If a suitable procedure is found for evaluation of the measured data, a microscopic image with a higher resolution than under flat illumination can be obtained. A simple method for generation of a laterally modulated illumination pattern is discussed here. A specially constructed diffraction grating was inserted in the illumination beam path at the conjugate object plane (position of the adjustable aperture) and projected through the objective into the object. Microscopic beads were imaged with this method and evaluated with an algorithm based on the structure of the Fourier space. The results indicate an improvement of resolution.},

abstract = {The variety of waves which can be supported by a plane homogeneous interface includes surface waves of the forward and backward type, and several kinds of complex wave, the latter being characterized by wave numbers which are complex even though the media involved are not necessarily lossy. The present study views all these waves as contributions due to poles in several alternative integral representations of a source-excited field, and places particular stress on the steepest-descent representation. The pole locations, field distributions and power-transport properties are explored in detail for all the wave types. Distinctions are made between proper (spectral, modal) and improper waves, and between lossy and lossless structures; complex waves along lossless structures are shown to appear always in degenerate pairs consisting of a forward and a backward wave, with interesting power-flow characteristics. The different wave types are grouped into the general category of guided complex waves which propagate without attenuation as inhomogeneous slow plane waves at some angle to the interface. Power-transport considerations via the steepest-descent representation show that these waves either carry power to compensate for losses in the system or account for a transfer of energy into the radiation field.},

abstract = {The presence of complex waves in the near field of a source-excited plane homogeneous interface is shown to play an important role in determining certain features of the radiation field. A Kirchhoff-Huygens integration over the near field reveals that, whenever these complex waves are strongly excited, they account for peaks in the radiation pattern. Under unidirectional excitation, each complex wave yields a single peak at some oblique angle; for bi-directional excitation, either two peaks appear symmetrically located about a normal to the interface, or a single peak is present in this normal (broadside-on) direction. It is also shown that, when the complex wave is slowly decaying at the interface, the peaks occur close to the angle of definition $\theta$c for that wave. These angles of maximum radiation and the associated gain functions are expressed, in all these cases, in terms of the location in the steepest-descent plane of the pole corresponding to the complex wave. These features are also shown to be consistent with the radiation mechanism discussed in the companion paper, Part I.},

abstract = {Contrary to the well known diffraction limit, the fluorescence microscope is in principle capable of unlimited resolution. The necessary elements are spatially structured illumination light and a nonlinear dependence of the fluorescence emission rate on the illumination intensity. As an example of this concept, this article experimentally demonstrates saturated structured-illumination microscopy, a recently proposed method in which the nonlinearity arises from saturation of the excited state. This method can be used in a simple, wide-field (nonscanning) microscope, uses only a single, inexpensive laser, and requires no unusual photophysical properties of the fluorophore. The practical resolving power is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn is limited by photobleaching. Experimental results show that a 2D point resolution of <50 nm is possible on sufficiently bright and photostable samples.},

@article{Jackson2000a,
abstract = {The nature of the current on a general multilayered printed-circuit stripline structure excited by a delta-gap source is investigated. The current is obtained through the construction of a semianalytical three-dimensional (3-D) Green's function, which accounts for the presence of the infinite conducting strip and the layered background structure. The 3-D Green's function is obtained by Fourier transforming the delta-gap source in the longitudinal (z) direction, which effectively resolves the 3-D problem of a delta-gap source into a superposition of 2-D problems, each of which is infinite in the z direction. The analysis allows for a convenient decomposition of the strip current into a sum of constituent parts. In particular, the strip current is first resolved into a set of bound-mode current waves and a continuous-spectrum current. The continuous-spectrum current is then represented as a set of physical leaky-mode currents in addition to a set of "residual-wave" currents, which arise from the steepest-descent integration paths. An asymptotic analysis reveals that the residual-wave currents decay algebraically as z(-3/2). Far away from the source, the residual-wave currents dominate the continuous-spectrum strip current. Results are shown for a specific type of stripline structure, but the analysis and conclusions are valid for arbitrary multilayer stripline structures.},

The fundamental resonance behaves similarly to the current resonance in an RLC circuit. It has been concluded that, even at room temperature, a slot diode with a two-dimensional electron channel provides a resonant circuit at terahertz frequencies that couples effectively to external electromagnetic radiation with a loaded Q-factor exceeding unity.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new Windowed Green Function (WGF) method for the numerical integral-equation solution of problems of electromagnetic scattering by obstacles in presence of dielectric or conducting half-planes. The WGF method, which is based on use of integral kernels that can be expressed directly in terms of the free-space Green function, does not require evaluation of expensive Sommerfeld integrals. The proposed approach is fast, accurate, flexible and easy to implement. In particular straightforward modifications of existing (accelerated or unaccelerated) solvers suffice to incorporate the WGF capability. The mathematical basis of the method is simple: it relies on a certain integral equation posed on the union of the obstacle and a small flat section of the interface between the two penetrable media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both the near- and far-field errors resulting from the proposed approach decrease faster than any negative power of the window size. In the examples considered in this paper, the proposed method is up to thousands of times faster, for a given accuracy, than a corresponding method based on the layer-Green-function.

abstract = {Standing-wave fluorescence microscopy, a method which utilizes interference to create a periodic excitation pattern along the optical axis, has been shown to provide improved axial resolution in thin, fluorescently labeled specimens. In each plane of focus, a complete standing wave data set is obtained by acquiring an image at each of three distinct positions of the interference fringes. Thicker specimens require through-focus data consisting of three images per plane. In this report we describe the recovery of information from this data using 3D image processing. The effective optical transfer function (OTF) of the standing wave microscope consists of the conventional OTF and two sidebands which are copies of the conventional OTF shifted axially by the spatial frequency of the interference fringes. The large gaps between the central band and the sidebands lead to significant ringing in the 3D reconstruction if linear deconvolution methods are employed. The use of non-linear, constrained image processing techniques has been shown to allow accurate extrapolation outside the OTF band limit. We demonstrate the extent to which the sidebands enhance recovery of information in the gaps, and provide a comparison between deconvolution using inverse-filtering and maximum-likelihood estimation.},

abstract = {Optical far-field microscopes are essential tools for investigations in many disciplines in science and engineering. They combine convenient sample preparation with high imaging speed. Furthermore, the underlying physics of image formation in light microscopes are deeply understood. Therefore, image interpretation is much more evident than particularly in scanning probe techniques. Fluorescence microscopy additionally takes advantage of very specifically staining individual components of the object. Today, fluorescence microscopy has a large number of applications in biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the resolution of optical far-field instruments is limited by the well known Rayleigh criterion. It predicts that two points cannot be distinguished if their lateral distance falls below approximately 240 nm in case of green light and oil-immersion objectives. During the last decade, various efforts have been undertaken to enhance the resolution of optical microscopes. The most common advancement in light microscopy is the confocal scanning microscope. By scanning a diffraction limited light spot through the specimen, the confocal microscope increases the lateral resolution by a factor of 1.5 under ideal conditions and, in addition, drastically enhances the optical sectioning capability. In this thesis, a method called harmonic excitation light microscopy (HELM) is described which allows one to more than double the lateral resolution in fluorescence microscopy by illuminating the specimen with a mesh-like interference pattern and electronic postprocessing of the images. The employed interference pattern covers the full field of view and can be shifted in two dimensions relative to the specimen by piezo actuators. Five images for different positions of the pattern are recorded by a camera. From these five images, additional information not accessible in conventional fluorescence microscopy can be extracted by an algebraic approach. A setup producing harmonic excitation patterns in the object plane of a microscope by interference of laser beams has been realized. Images of artificial as well as biological samples show that HELM achieves a true optical resolution of approx. 100 nm. Therefore, HELM even outperforms the lateral resolving power of CFM by a factor of more than 1.5 and, additionally, avoids disadvantages of scanning methods. A further part of the thesis deals with a three-dimensional extension of HELM. Basically, three-dimensional imaging is possible by stepping the focus through the object and acquiring a stack of two-dimensional images. However, the axial resolving power of conventional as well as confocal microscopes is far below the lateral one. By numeric simulations, a three-dimensional HELM device is shown to achieve an unrivaled resolution of approx. 100 nm laterally as well as axially. Since the system requirements for three-dimensional HELM are similar to those of confocal devices, it is expected that such systems could become a superior alternative to confocal ones, even from a commercial point of view.},

Although several implementations of the argument principle already exist, ours has several advantages: it allows singularities within the search domain and branch points are not fatal to the method. Furthermore, our implementation is simple and is written in MATLAB, fulfilling the need for an easily integrated implementation which can be readily modified to accommodate the many variations of the argument principle method, each of which is suited to a different application. We apply the method to the step index fiber dispersion relation, which has become topical due to the recent proliferation of high index contrast fibers. We also find modes with permittivity as the eigenvalue, catering to recent numerical methods that expand the radiation of sources by eigenmodes.},

Using the prototypical LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a model system, we employ a single-step lithographic process to realize gate tunable Josephson junctions through a combination of lateral confinement and local side gating. The action of the side gates is found to be comparable to that of a local back gate, constituting a robust and efficient way to control the properties of the interface at the nanoscale. We demonstrate that the side gates enable reliable tuning of both the normal-state resistance and the critical (Josephson) current of the constrictions. The conductance and Josephson current show mesoscopic fluctuations as a function of the applied side gate voltage, and the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be consistent with a long junction. Finally, we realize a superconducting quantum interference device in which the critical currents of each of the constriction-type Josephson junctions can be controlled independently via the side gates.},

abstract = {Plasmons in low-dimensional systems respresent an important tool for coupling energy into nanostructures and the localization of energy on the scale of only a few nanometers. Contrary to ordinary surface plasmons of metallic bulk materials, their dispersion goes to zero in the long wavelength limit, thus covering a broad range of energies from terahertz to near infrared, and from mesoscopic wavelengths down to just a few nanometers. Using specific and most characteristic examples, we review first the properties of plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) metallic layers from an experimental point of view. As demonstrated, tuning of their dispersion is possible by changes of charge carrier concentration in the partially filled 2D conduction bands, but for the relativistic electron gas like in graphene only in the long wavelength limit. For short wavelengths, on the other hand, the dispersion turns out to be independent of the position of the Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point. A linear dispersion, seen under the latter conditions in graphene, can also be obtained in non-relativistic electron gases by coupling between 2D and 3D electronic systems. As a well investigated example, the acoustic surface plasmons in Shockley surface states, coupled with the bulk electronic system, are discussed. Also the introduction of anisotropy, e.g. by regular arrays of steps, seems to result in linearization (and to partial localization of the plasmons normal to the steps, depending on wavelengths). In quasi-one dimensional (1D) systems, such as arrays of gold chains on regularly stepped Si surfaces, only the dispersion is 1D, whereas shape and slope of the dispersion curves depend on the 2D distribution of charge within each terrace and on coupling between wires on different terraces.},

abstract = {The division of the near-field and far-field zones for electromagnetic waves is important for simplifying theoretical calculations and applying far-field results. In this paper, we have studied the far-field asymptotic behaviors of dipole radiations in stratified backgrounds and obtained a universal empirical expression of near-field/far-field (NFFF) boundary. The boundary is mainly affected by lateral waves, which corresponds to branch point contributions in Sommerfeld integrals. In a semispace with a higher refractive index, the NFFF boundary is determined by a dimensional parameter and usually larger than the operating wavelength by at least two orders of magnitude. In a semispace with the lowest refractive index in the structure (usually air), the NFFF boundary is about ten wavelengths. Moreover, different treatments in the asymptotic method are discussed and numerically compared. An equivalence between the field expressions obtained from the asymptotic method and those from reciprocal theorem is demonstrated. Our determination of the NFFF boundary will be useful in the fields such as antenna design, remote sensing, and underwater communication.},

abstract = {Studies of properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic fields by optical spectroscopy is presented: fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studied by photoluminescence and inelastic light scattering in high fields, and a recently discovered effect of microwave induced resistance oscillations (MIROs) by transport and absorption measurements in low fields. Until now, series of FQHE states, arising due to electron interaction, were not observed in photoluminescence. This work reports on optical detection of a whole family of 1/2 fractional states observed in photoluminescence. The features reflect pattern analogous to the one observed by the magneto--resistivity traces. The strongest features observed even in raw data include fractions 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, 3/5, 2/3 , and 1 on either side of the 1/2 state. The last chapter describes the studies of the new effect of microwave resistance induced oscillations (MIROs). When irradiated with microwaves, the behaviour of 2DEG transport properties deviates from the Shubnikov -- de Haas oscillations. The resistance traces exhibit series of vanishing resistance states. The frequency dependence of transport data shows a gradual changeover from transport traces reflecting MIROs in low microwave frequencies, to traces showing nearly the cyclotron resonance only. The results of the absorption measurements validate description of the MIROs as the result of oscillatory density of states. Also, the existence of two separate absorption processes are suggested to explain the microwave polarisation independence of MIROs, and the crossover from MIROs-like transport data at low frequencies to cyclotron--like traces at higher frequencies.},

abstract = {In this tutorial paper, we formulate a two-dimensional integral-equation based method of moments approach for numerically computing the electromagnetic fields scattered from an azimuthally-rough dielectric cylinder or an axially-rough perfectly conducting cylinder. The electric field integral equation is discretized in both the cases to yield a system of linear equations, and a detailed evaluation of the matrix elements involved in this system of equations is presented. Numerical computation of important quantities such as the scattering cross-section or the scattered electric fields is also discussed. The primary purpose of this numerical scheme is to validate perturbative solutions that arise in the context of rough cylinder scattering problems.},

  abstract = {Unveiling the full potential of doped silicon for electronic, photonic, and plasmonic application at THz frequencies requires a thorough understanding of its high-frequency transport properties. In this letter, we present a comprehensive numerical characterization of the frequency-dependent (0-2.5 THz) complex conductivity of silicon at room temperature over a wide range of doping densities (10 14-10 18 cm -3). The conductivity was calculated using a multiphysics computational technique that self-consistently couples ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) simulation of carrier transport, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution to Maxwell's equations, and molecular dynamics (MD) for the treatment of short-range Coulomb interactions. Our EMC/FDTD/MD numerical results complement the experimental data that only exist for a select few doping densities. Moreover, we show that the computed complex conductivity of Si at THz frequencies can be accurately described by a generalized Drude (GD) model with doping-dependent parameters that capture the cross-over from phonon-dominated to Coulomb-dominated electron transport as the doping density increases. The simplicity of the GD model enables one to readily compute the complex conductivity of silicon for any doping density within the range studied here.},
