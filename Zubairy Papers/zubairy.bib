  abstract  = {A novel terahertz plasma-wave photomixer that can improve the conversion gain and terahertz radiation power is proposed and evaluated. The photomixer is based on a high-electron mobility transistor and incorporates doubly interdigitated grating strips for the gate electrodes that periodically localize the 2D plasmons in 100-nm regions with a micron-order interval. A vertical cavity structure is formed in between the top metal grating and a terahertz mirror placed at the backside. The device features electronic tuning of plasmon characteristic frequencies, providing continuously-tunable operation below 1 THz to beyond 10 THz. Frequency-dependent finite-differential time-domain analysis demonstrates that the grating-bicoupled plasmonic structure acts as a broadband terahertz photomixer and antenna and that the vertical cavity structure effectively enhances the conversion gain and radiation power.},

  abstract      = {Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a very important super-resolution microscopy technique, which provides high speed super-resolution with about two-fold spatial resolution enhancement. Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported. However, most of these highlight only one specific aspect of the SIM reconstruction -- such as the determination of the illumination pattern phase shift accurately -- whereas other key elements -- such as determination of modulation factor, estimation of object power spectrum, Wiener filtering frequency components with inclusion of object power spectrum information, translocating and the merging of the overlapping frequency components -- are usually glossed over superficially. In addition, most of the work reported lie scattered throughout the literature and a comprehensive review of the theoretical background is found lacking. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) to collect the essential theoretical details of SIM algorithm at one place, thereby making them readily accessible to readers for the first time; and 2) to provide an open source SIM reconstruction code (named OpenSIM), which enables users to interactively vary the code parameters and study it's effect on reconstructed SIM image.},

Technological advances have provided new techniques for delivering FIR radiation to the human body. Specialty lamps and saunas, delivering pure FIR radiation (eliminating completely the near and mid infrared bands), have became safe, effective, and widely used sources to generate therapeutic effects. Fibers impregnated with FIR emitting ceramic nanoparticles and woven into fabrics, are being used as garments and wraps to generate FIR radiation, and attain health benefits from its effects.},

We find that the essential character of the response—multiple resonances corresponding to spatial harmonics of standing plasmons under the metal grating—is caused by the static spatial modulation of electron density in the channel. Higher order plasmon modes become more optically active as the depth of the electron density modulation in the DQW tends towards unity. The maximum absorbance, at plasma resonance, is shown to be 1/2. Furthermore, the strongest absorption also occurs when the standing plasmon resonance coincides with the fundamental dipole mode of the ungated portion of the channel.},

The necessary elements are spatially structured illumination light and a nonlinear dependence of the fluorescence emission rate on the illumination intensity. As an example of this concept, this article experimentally demonstrates saturated structured-illumination microscopy, a recently proposed method in which the nonlinearity arises from saturation of the excited state. This method can be used in a simple, wide-field (nonscanning) microscope, uses only a single, inexpensive laser, and requires no unusual photophysical properties of the fluorophore. The practical resolving power is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn is limited by photobleaching. Experimental results show that a 2D point resolution of <50 nm is possible on sufficiently bright and photostable samples.},

  abstract  = {The advancement in fluorescence microscopy has dramatically enhanced the obtainable optical resolution enabling the users to inspect the structures of interest at finer and finer level of detail. This chapter describes some of these methods and how they break the classical resolution limit. The labeling of targets, such as individual genetic loci, specific proteins, or organelles, is possible inside living cells, which led to the extensive use of fluorescence microscopy in life sciences. Other microscopic modes usually lack this high specificity but sometimes provide other useful information such as the orientation of molecular species in polarization microscopy. Modes, such as differential interference contrast, phase contrast, or dark field, are useful to discriminate and follow cells or structures within them without the need for specific labeling. However, classically the resolution of all of these light microscopic modes was far below that of the electron microscope, and only some recent approaches have made significant progress in resolution increase. Recently, many microscopy methods have dramatically enhanced the resolution. Gradually, these methods are now applied to solve biological problems. The most promising approaches are all based on fluorescence and use either nonlinear interaction of light with the sample (STED, nonlinear structured illumination, dynamic saturation optical microscopy, or saturation in the time domain) or precise localization of individual particles or molecules with subsequent image generation. ?? 2006 Oxford University Press.

It is shown that all characteristic electromagnetic lengths (scattering, absorption, and extinction lengths), as well as the impedance of the diode, exhibit resonances at plasmon excitation frequencies in the channel. The fundamental resonance behaves similarly to the current resonance in an RLC circuit. It has been concluded that, even at room temperature, a slot diode with a two-dimensional electron channel provides a resonant circuit at terahertz frequencies that couples effectively to external electromagnetic radiation with a loaded Q-factor exceeding unity. The diode resistance may be measured from contactless measurements of the characteristic electromagnetic lengths of the diode. (C) 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

  abstract  = {We predict instability of the steady state with a direct current for an ungated two-dimensional (2D) electron layer. This instability caused by the current flow is similar to the "shallow water" instability in the gated 2D electron gas [see M. Dyakonov and M. S. Shur, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 2465 (1993)]. The mathematics of the problem correspond to "deep water" solutions for plasma waves. Just like in the "shallow water" case, this instability occurs when the boundary conditions correspond to zero ac voltage at the source and zero ac current at the drain. Such boundary conditions can be realized using either an external circuit or a depleted region at the drain. For the same device dimensions and electron mobility, the plasma wave generated in an ungated 2D device has a much higher frequency and, as a consequence, a much higher resonance quality factor, which makes the ungated devices promising for applications in resonant terahertz detectors.

In each plane of focus, a complete standing wave data set is obtained by acquiring an image at each of three distinct positions of the interference fringes. Thicker specimens require through-focus data consisting of three images per plane. In this report we describe the recovery of information from this data using 3D image processing. The effective optical transfer function (OTF) of the standing wave microscope consists of the conventional OTF and two sidebands which are copies of the conventional OTF shifted axially by the spatial frequency of the interference fringes. The large gaps between the central band and the sidebands lead to significant ringing in the 3D reconstruction if linear deconvolution methods are employed. The use of non-linear, constrained image processing techniques has been shown to allow accurate extrapolation outside the OTF band limit. We demonstrate the extent to which the sidebands enhance recovery of information in the gaps, and provide a comparison between deconvolution using inverse-filtering and maximum-likelihood estimation.},

Here we report both generation and detection of broadband terahertz field from 10 nm scale oxide nanojunctions. Frequency components of ultrafast optical radiation are mixed at these nanojunctions, producing broadband THz emission. These same devices detect THz electric fields with comparable spatial resolution. This unprecedented control, on a scale of 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit, creates a pathway toward THz-bandwidth spectroscopy and control of individual nanoparticles and molecules.},

  abstract  = {At the start of this millennium, the principles of structured illumination microscopy (SIM) had been established and the concept of resolution doubling demonstrated experimentally in two dimensions. Breathtaking advances have since taken place, making SIM one of the most powerful and versatile superresolution methods available today, routinely used in the study of biochemical processes in laboratories around the world. In theory there is no inherent limit to the resolution obtainable with certain modalities of SIM, and new variants have the potential to operate at even higher speeds and sensitivity than currently realized. In this review, we focus on the very latest innovations in SIM theory and practice, which are set to continue the revolution of this method into the future. Examples include confocal implementations of the SIM principle, which can be used in combination with two-photon excitation and adaptive optics. We present recent applications of such approaches in the life sciences, which illustrate their potential to revolutionize intravital research, by providing the ability to watch life at the molecular scale, at high speeds, and deep within living organisms. A different variant makes use of standing plasmonic waves or localized surface plasmons to confer performance enhancements to 2D SIM modalities. Research on these latter techniques is in its infancy but already shows great potential for their development into powerful in vitro probes for chemical processes at solid/liquid interfaces. Physical concepts are reviewed in detail, and future directions are presented along which the field might fruitfully develop, holding promise for new discoveries on the molecular scale.},
