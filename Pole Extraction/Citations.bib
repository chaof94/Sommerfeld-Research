W is bounded by a simple closed curve and f (z) must be holomorphic within W. We have developed and tested the package to support our work in the modeling of high frequency and optical wave guiding and resonant structures. The respective eigenvalue problems are particularly challenging because they require the high precision computation of all multiple complex roots of f (z) confined to the specified finite domain. Generally f (z), despite being holomorphic, does not have explicit analytical form thereby inhibiting evaluation of its derivatives. Program summary: Title of program:EZERO.

The error analysis shows an additional term, which represents the quasi-static image of the surface-wave poles plays a crucial role in the convergence and accuracy of this new method.

Although several implementations of the argument principle already exist, ours has several advantages: it allows singularities within the search domain and branch points are not fatal to the method. Furthermore, our implementation is simple and is written in MATLAB, fulfilling the need for an easily integrated implementation which can be readily modified to accommodate the many variations of the argument principle method, each of which is suited to a different application. We apply the method to the step index fiber dispersion relation, which has become topical due to the recent proliferation of high index contrast fibers. We also find modes with permittivity as the eigenvalue, catering to recent numerical methods that expand the radiation of sources by eigenmodes.},
